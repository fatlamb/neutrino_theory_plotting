change phi to negative angle convention
relative as fraction of numerical (linear scale)
red and green, blue (relative to each)
change probability to survivial percentage
change e-16 to 10^-16 
change v to zero (plain zero)
same font in units

match all font sizes
use energies in TeV (everywhere)
make eps files

include all this in the latex file
12 point latex caption
size of numbers should match size of axis font scales.
"neutrino survival percentage calculated for parameters X shown for a full numerical calcualtion and perturbative orders" Caption figure

legend with fancybox=true (round edges)

Times new roman for everything

cut percentage at 0.5, or use two param sets
tic marks larger

units: convention of
energy -> neurino energy /TeV, or [TeV] <- this one: make two for comparison

try order 2 

mention that there are two!
call order 0 standard vacuum oscillation (no confusion)
be explicit about both approximations (QM and taylor).
call order 1: perturbation
add the order 1 QM as a line. Then add the 1st order epsilon expansion.
fix misalignment! in twinx plots
relative are will illuminate
in lambda panel, keep absolutes

merge two lambda into one plot, one dash, one solid. X axis will have lam1 (lam2)
caption explanation

overlay matter and vacuum phi plots to chart motion.


solve the phiset by diagonalizing numerically. compare.

-----------------------------------------------

check first order and second order truncations with direct mathematica script calls

phi overlay 

lambda overlay

latex
-----------------------------------------------
investigate mismatch in energy

fraction of V

define hamiltonian: define each term
constant density, define diagonal solution
put 1st and 2nd pert: put formulae


then put numerical plots: next section (earth section)

spaghetti plots, and oscillograms.
